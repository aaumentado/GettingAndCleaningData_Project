## CodeBook for run_analysis.R script

### Definition of variables used

run\_analysis.R uses the following files found in this repository to identify the feature variable names and human readable activity names

feature names: UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt
This is a 2 column white space delimited file
The first column is the index number of feature
The second column is the feature variable name

activity names: UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt
This is a 2 column white space delimited file
The first column is the activity key (integer 1 through 6)
The second column is the activity name

the load_and_merge_datasets() function will first load the feature and activity names and use them to generate the activity names and feature variable names

Note that the feature variable names in the final dataset are the exact literal feature names in features.txt and are therefore liberal

i.e. if using read.table(..., col.names = <features names>) will create non-liberal version of name, e.g. tBodyAcc-mean()-X would convert to tBodyAcc.mean...X which makes it harder to do some automation of column searching, see below

there are three datasets loaded per dataset group (\* = training, test):
subject_*_data: the subject id number associated to a feature vector measurement
y_*_data: the activity key number associated to a feature vector measurement
X_*_data: the 561 valued feature vector containing HAR data

Initial merging is a cbind of the subject data "subject.id", activity data "activity.number", and the actual feature vector data
